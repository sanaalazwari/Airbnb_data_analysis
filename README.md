## About this project
The aim of this project is to analyze Seattle Airbnb data for Udadcity Nanodegree Program. 
Many of the approaches and code I use here can be applied to different Airbnb datasets. 
You can have a look at [my medium post] (https://sana-alazwari.medium.com/airbnb-in-seattle-a-data-science-approach-1db5f3e9f360) regarding the analysis of Seattle Airbnb dataset.

**This Project answers three main questions as follows:**
**1- Which neighborhoods have the highest number of listings?**
Among all Seattle's neighborhoods, Analysing the dataset shows that Capitol Hill, Downtown and Central Area are the highest neighborhoods in the number of listings.
**2- Which neighborhoods have the highest listing prices?**
Magnolia, Downtown and Queen Ann are the top three neighborhoods with the most expensive listings prices.
**3- Which neighborhoods have the highest rating review scores?**
Although the rating review scores are quite similar to almost all neighborhoods, Interbay, Central Area and Seward Park have slightly higher reveiw scores. 

## Files Description
This project includes only one notebook (airbnbvis.ipynb) and three csv files:
1- airbnb_listings.csv
2- reviews.csv
3- listing_price.csv

## Acknowledgement
I would like to thank Airbnb for publishing their data and making it open to the public. I would like to thank Udacity for their great Data Science Nanodegree Program.
